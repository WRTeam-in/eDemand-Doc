# Booking Auto Cancel Duration

If the booking is not accepted by the provider before the added cancelable duration from the actual booking time, the booking will be automatically canceled. If the booking is pre-paid, the amount will be credited to the customer's bank account.

For example, if a customer books a service at 4:00 PM, and the cancelable duration is 30 minutes, if the provider does not accept the booking by 3:30 PM, the booking will be canceled.
