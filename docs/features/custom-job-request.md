# Custom Job Request

Custom Job Request allows customers to post specific job requirements and receive bids from interested service providers. This creates a flexible system where customers can find the right provider for their unique needs.

## How It Works

### 1. Custom Job Request setting

- Providers can enable/disable custom job request setting from their respective app and panel:

### 2. Setting up preferences

- Providers can customize what jobs they want to see by:
- Selecting their service categories (e.g., plumbing, cleaning, painting)

![Manage Category Preference App](../../static/img/adminPanel/manage_category_preference_app.jpg)

### 3. Customer request the Job

- Create a detailed job request explaining what they need
- Describe their requirements
- Set their budget expectations
- Specify when they need the job done
- Add any special instructions

### 4. Provider will receive the Job Requests

Provider gets notifications only for jobs that:
- Match their selected categories
- Are in their service area

When providers see a job they're interested in, they can:
- Review the complete job details

- If selected, receive booking confirmation and customer details

### 6. Customer can see the bid and book Provider

- The request is shared with relevant service providers
