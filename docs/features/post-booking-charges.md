# Post-Booking Charges

- This feature enables both service providers and administrators to add extra charges to a booking after it has been created. The additional charges can be applied to accommodate unforeseen costs, extra services requested by the customer, or other adjustments necessary for the booking.
- Only the provider or admin can complete the booking if the payment for additional charges has been made. If no additional charges are added, the booking can be completed without this requirement.
- When changing the booking status to **Booking Ended** provider/admin can add additional charges and upload proof of work completion.
