<!-- For **With SEO Support**:
- **VPS Hosting**: A Virtual Private Server (VPS) is mandatory to ensure reliable performance and security. Shared hosting environments are not supported for this web application.
- **Node.js Support**: The server must support Node.js, as it is essential for running the application.
- **Memory Requirements**: The server should have at least 3-4 GB of free RAM to handle the application's processes effectively.
