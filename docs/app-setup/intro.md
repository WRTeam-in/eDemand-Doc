# App Prerequisites

:::note

We recommend deploying the web application on the main domain and the admin panel on a subdomain.

<!-- For **With SEO Support**:
- **VPS Hosting**: A Virtual Private Server (VPS) is mandatory to ensure reliable performance and security. Shared hosting environments are not supported for this web application.
- **Node.js Support**: The server must support Node.js, as it is essential for running the application.
- **Memory Requirements**: The server should have at least 3-4 GB of free RAM to handle the application's processes effectively.
- **SSH Root Access**: The server must provide SSH root access to execute Node.js commands and manage the application. -->

:::

<!-- :::caution

A VPS server is only required if you plan to use the web application with **SEO**. However, if you are only using the web application without SEO, the app, and the admin panel, you can opt for a shared hosting server as it is sufficient for these components.
