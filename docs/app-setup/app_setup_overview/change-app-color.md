## ðŸŒˆ Updating App Colors in Flutter  

  1. Navigate to the following directory in your Flutter project:  

     ```
     lib > utils > colors.dart
     ```

  2. Open the **`colors.dart`** file.  
  3. Add or modify your color codes using **hexadecimal values**.  
  4. In Flutter, colors follow this format:  

     ```dart
     Color myPrimaryColor = Color(0xff123456); // Replace with your hex code
     ```

     -   `0xff` â†’ **Mandatory prefix** for hexadecimal color codes.  
     -   `123456` â†’ Replace with your desired **hex color code**.  

  5. Update colors for **primary, secondary, accent, and subheading** elements.
