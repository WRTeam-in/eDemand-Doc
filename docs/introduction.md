# Welcome to eDemand

Welcome to eDemand â€“ your all-in-one solution for managing and operating a powerful service-based application platform.

This documentation will help you set up, customize, and launch your eDemand platform, whether you are working with the mobile app, the web admin panel, or both.

This guide covers both the ***eDemand Mobile App, web*** and the Admin Panel. While they are distinct products, they are designed to work seamlessly together.

## Version Compatibility
