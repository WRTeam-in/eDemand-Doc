## How to auto update your admin panel or web version to latest version?

> **Note**: If you are upgrading from a very old version then please update the system in sequence one after the another. Don't skip any version in between.

1. Find **update from vX.X to vX.X.X.zip** file from downloaded PHP source code. You will find file on this location: eDemand admin - current_version/Updates/your_required_version_update_file.zip

2. Visit `your_url/admin/settings/updater`

3. You will see simple instructions, current version to latest version information and **"Update The System"** button.

4. Upload **update.zip** file.

5. Click on that Update Button.

6. That's all. You have successfully updated your system from older version to newer one.
